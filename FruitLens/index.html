              This project was created by Juan Sanchez Roa and Ryan Nguyen.
              You can find out more about us through our websites and GitHub links.
              Here are other links which you can check out as well.

            <h3><strong>Description of Project</strong></h3>
            <p>
              This project takes in an input of an image and uses machine learning technology to indentify what fruit is being displayed.
              Juan took the approach of creating the front end development by creating the website and its functionality.
              Ryan decided on coding and training a machine learning model that would run in the back end to identify whatever picture it got sent.

            <h3><strong>Resources Used</strong></h3>
            <p>
              This was our first project using the kind of technologies that we had available to us.
              For this reason we had to reference many sites for documentation and guidance.
              Here we will include a list of some sites, videos, or images we used to create the project,
              whether it was icon images, a quick tutorial, or an in depth article on specific tools used.
